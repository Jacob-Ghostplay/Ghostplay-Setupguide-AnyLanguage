Tips:

Tip 1: Easy mentioning roles.
	Type the role like you want to mention it but remove the @ before you send the message.

Tip 2: Mentioning the bot role.
	You can NOT mention the highest role the bot has.

Tip 3: Way to read this message:
	Follow every step from the start. (Or step 2 since you most likely already invited the bot.)
