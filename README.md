What is this, you wonder? \
We, Ghostplay Staff noticed that a lot of people who don't speak english need help with setting up their bot. \
As you all know, we have #faq, thanks to Shapax for making this! <3 \
Now, we will introduce this chat. 

Straightforward, \
This chat is meant as little guideline in other languages so it is easy for you to work with our bots.


In this project we thank: \
- Members who have these language as their home language: 
	If you speak another language, please direct message Jacob. Credits will be given if you help out. 
- Shapax: \
	For giving the idea of helping via a chat and supporting this idea in the first place. (had some slack before release) 
- Welsh: \
	Without him I wouldn't have made this anyway, thank you for the amazing Ghostplay bots.
